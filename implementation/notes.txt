remove productData and customerData, instead have customer and product inherit directly from pure virtual nodedata
make customer and product inherit from nodedata
nodedata would be pure virtual

For the productCollection list of trees you can just use an array of 26 (each element being a char and pointing to a tree)


Things we got marked down on:
	Forgot main in design

Casting inside override of comparison operators for product and customer class. (Product and customer class comparison operators should take in a nodedata which might later be casted)

Notes from thursday Meeting:
Hey,

I emailed Zander about Robert not being able to make it., but I never got a response so I assume she was in meetings until we met at 9:30Pm. 

Here are some notes from the meeting.

Customers can be stored in an array of 10,000.

Pass in stream for setData

LinkedList in Collection Tree can be an Array / Hashtable

Make more of Product pure virtual (The comparison operators)

Have Product and Customer be subclasses of NodeData, and get rid of ProductData and CustomerData. Have Product and Customer have the the comparison Operator for NodeData.
EX:
In Product: virtual bool operator > (const NodeData&) const = 0;

Make a function called ProcessCommands in manager that can take in multiple commands.

We will get our grade Monday.
