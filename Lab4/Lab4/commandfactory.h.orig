/*
A factory that produces Commands based on a key to a hashtable containing the 
different types of Command objects.

The CommandFactory constructor that takes a CustomerIndex and a 
ProductCollection is used to pass along the two data structures to it's 
products.

The create method takes in a string and parses out the command portion of the
string. It then creates an instance of a child command object based on the 
command it parsed. Finally, it returns a pointer to that command.
